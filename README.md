# The Wandering Vocabulary Traveler

The story will involve a wandering traveler who loves treasure hunting in every city she travels. Each city is named after an unfamiliar word that the traveler must discover what that word means to obtain a treasure locked behind a magical gate that requires badges to unlock the door that contains a treasure, which will be the main task of each city.
